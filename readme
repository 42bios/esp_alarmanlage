About:
This repository hosts the code and documentation for a simple and compact alarm system, 
specifically designed for integration with ESPhome and Homeassistant. 
The project leverages various hardware components, including an Olimex ESP32-POE-ISO, 
an OLED display, a 4x3 keypad matrix, an NFC Reader, and door contacts managed with a MCP23017 I/O expander.

Key Features:
Connectivity: Utilizes LAN connection.
User Interface: Features a 128x32 OLED 0.91" I2C display for status information.
Security: Includes an NFC reader (model mfrc522) and door contacts for comprehensive security.

Future goals:
One of my ambitious goals for the future is to seamlessly integrate the keypad, OLED, and LEDs into a Jung LS 990 blind cover. 
Thus, the project should be in line with the existing switch program in the house. 
Key aspects of this goal include:
- Optimizing the Design: 
    Ensuring that the keypad, OLED, and LEDs fit into the Jung LS 990 blind cover without losing functionality.
- Visual Harmony: 
    Achieving a look that complements the existing fixtures and aesthetics.

By aligning with the current switch design, I aim to create a coherent and visually appealing integration 
that adds both functionality and style to the home environment.
